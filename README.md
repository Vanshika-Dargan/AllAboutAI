## Project Overview

This project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, incorporating various tools and technologies to create a robust and secure web application. Key contributions include leveraging Express for the backend architecture, managing MongoDB interactions via Mongoose, implementing secure authentication using JWT tokens and Bcrypt for password hashing.

## Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack:**
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
  - Express.js: Backend framework for building robust and scalable applications.
  - React: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.

- **Authentication:**
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for secure user authentication.
  - Bcrypt: Employed for password hashing to enhance security.

- **Logging and Styling:**
  - Morgan: Utilized for server logging to monitor and analyze server-side activities.
  - Winston: Implemented for application logs to ensure efficient log management.
  - Chalk: Used for terminal styling to enhance readability.

- **Validation:**
  - Joi: Ensured data integrity through Joi's validation.

- **Frontend Technologies:**
  - Material UI: Employed for frontend styling to create a visually appealing interface.
  - Axios: Used for network calls to interact with the backend.
  - RTK (Redux Toolkit): Implemented for global state management.
  - React-Toastify: Integrated for displaying notifications to users.

## Key Contributions

- Led the development of custom user logic for sign-in and login.
- Proficiently maintained application logs using Winston and managed server logs with Morgan.
- Ensured data integrity through Joi’s validation.

## Frontend Contributions

- Contributed to the AllAboutAI’s frontend using Material UI for styling.
- Utilized Axios for network calls and RTK for global state management.
- Implemented CRUD operations enabling users to create, upvote/downvote discussions, participate, delete their posts, and comment—accessible only to logged-in users.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend server using Node.js and Express.
3. Connect the backend to MongoDB using Mongoose.
4. Implement frontend components using React and Material UI.
5. Configure authentication using JWT and Bcrypt.
6. Run the application and start exploring the features.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project!

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the application.
